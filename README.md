**NOTE:** This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview:

For this project, I dicided to use Creacte React App as my base since it provide already all webpack and testing settings.
No state management was used in this cenario.

I opted to use Typescript since I believe that make code easier and faster to develop/debug.

Some of the improvements that I would do:

- Change the page title and icon.
- Make use of branches and pull requests to submit the project.
- Redo all webpack settings to remove all unused configuration in order to improve build time and reduce the amount of packages required on installation.
- Make usage of import to load modules, and implement a solution like React-Loadable.
- Better tests implementation.
- Add a router with a default 404 page.

## Installation

In the project directory, please run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

**NOTE:** It may be needed to updated the services port. Please check the proxy property inside package.json file.
